// This TSConfig file is used when pnpm build is ran. It omits out
// unecessary files, such as anything involved in testing.
// This is a separate TSConfig file because VSCode (by default) uses
// the exclude list to find out what it should care about for typechecking
// while writing code.
// Since I still want my tests to take advantage of static typing, this is
// a necessary hack.
